# hello-ember

### My first Ember app

This is a basic CRUD app written with Ember.js. It allows a user to manage a list of servers, each
having a name, IP address, and hostname.

This app implements the RESTAdapter. The backend is a MongoDB-based RESTful web service. See 
[hello-mongo](https://github.com/evanstoner/hello-mongo).
